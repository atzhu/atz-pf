Project Title: Hello Ice Cream

This demo involves catching falling scoops of ice cream with a cone. Our original proposal was to implement balancing blocks on a platform. However, since we decided to not use additional libraries, we did not have any form of physics simulations and chose to only use collision detection to imitate really simple physics.

The colors of the ice cream scoops change randomly when a scoop is caught. This is entirely intentional to add more visual flair.

The main controls of this game use the WASD keys to move the cone to the desired position to catch the falling scoops.

There are also some basic camera controls:
Up and Down arrows pan the camera up and down.
Right and Left arrows rotate the camera around the starting position of the cone. This is to help the depth perception of some of the scoops.
The R key resets the camera view

Topics that have been included in the implementation:
Everything before the midterm such as:
Shape creation
Texture mapping
Lighting
Camera controls
etc.

Additional/Advanced topics that were covered:
Collision detection
Environment Mapping
Sound/Music?

This demo is meant to be played on a monitor with 1920x1080 resolution.
